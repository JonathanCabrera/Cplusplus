Create a program where can output the number's 1 and 0.


What will this program look like?

The goal of my project is to output a 1 when the user types
in "one", and when the user types in two â€” we will expect
to see the number "0" output.

Reflection:

The project was successful, I found it rough getting back in the swing
of things, I improved my ability to judge my time, finishing 30 minutes
ahead of schedule. I am proud of the workflow that was drafted when starting
this project. I will likely in the future improve, for now I can improve on
letting outside sources distract me less.
